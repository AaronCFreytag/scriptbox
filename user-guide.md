## Gameplay
### Account Creation
The first step to getting started with Scriptbox is creating an account. Accounts are kept on a login server that is separate from the game servers. Most of the information for the game (like the uploaded resources) is stored per-server. The account itself is essentially there to ensure that you are the only one who can connect to a server using your username.

To create an account, simply click "Sign Up", enter your account information, and then click "Sign Up" again. You will see a message indicating if your account creation was successful.

After creating an account, simply click "Log In" and log in using your account credentials.
### Resources
In Scriptbox, a "resource" is anything you upload or copy from the server for ingame use. This includes executable scripts, components, images, sounds, and prefabs. All of your resources are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

#### Uploading Resources
To upload a resource, click on "Upload..." inside of your resource window. A window will pop up where you can upload the resource you wish to upload. You can upload scripts, components, images, and audio files. Prefabs cannot be uploaded, but rather must be created from an object in the game.

- You can upload multiple resources at once by selecting multiple files in the file upload window.
#### Cloning Resources
[Default resources](#default-resources) or [shared resources](#sharing-resources) can be cloned from the server's resource repository. This repository can be accessed by clicking "Find Resources!". Simply type a search term into the search bar and hit enter to show listings in the repository that match the search term.

- Shared items are tagged based on their name and description

To clone an item from the repository, click on the item in the left side of the repository. From there, scroll down on the right side and click "Clone" to clone the resource into your personal resource listing. Once a resource is cloned, you can modify and use it freely.
